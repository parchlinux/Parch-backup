# Parch Backup

## Overview

The ParchLinux Backup Application is a utility designed to simplify the backup
process for ParchLinux users. It provides a comprehensive solution for backing
up installed applications, home directory, Flatpak packages (optional), and GPG
and SSH keys.

## Features
- Backup installed applications using Pacman
- Backup user's home directory
- Optional backup of Flatpak packages
- Backup GPG and SSH keys
- Restore from backups

## Roadmap
### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- [ ] Develop a command-line interface (CLI) for the application
- [ ] Implement the functionality to backup installed applications using Pacman
- [ ] Implement the functionality to backup the user's home directory
- [ ] Implement the functionality to backup GPG and SSH keys

### Phase 2: Flatpak Integration

- [ ] Add an option to backup Flatpak packages
- [ ] Integrate with the Flatpak package manager to list and backup installed Flatpak packages

### Phase 3: Restore Functionality

- [ ] Implement the functionality to restore backed-up applications using Pacman
- [ ] Implement the functionality to restore the user's home directory
- [ ] Implement the functionality to restore GPG and SSH keys
- [ ] Implement the functionality to restore Flatpak packages (if backed up)

### Phase 4: User Interface

- [ ] Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for the application
- [ ] Integrate the CLI functionality into the GUI
- [ ] Provide options to schedule backups and set backup locations

### Phase 5: Optimization and Testing

- [ ] Optimize the backup and restore processes for performance and efficiency
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing, including edge cases and error handling
- [ ] Implement error reporting and logging mechanisms

### Phase 6: Documentation and Release

- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation for users and developers
- [ ] Package the application for distribution
- [ ] Release the application to the ParchLinux community

## Dependencies
- Pacman / libalpm
- Flatpak (optional)

## Potential Challenges
- Handling large home directories and optimizing backup/restore times
